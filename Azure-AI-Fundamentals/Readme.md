# Common AI Workloads

### Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a key AI workload, primarily concerned with enabling computers to interpret and analyze visual data. This can include tasks like image classification, where the system recognizes and categorizes objects within images. Object detection focuses on identifying and locating multiple objects in visual data, while face recognition enables the identification of individuals based on their facial features. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) allows for extracting text from images, and image analysis provides insights like detecting emotions or understanding the content of scenes.

### Natrual Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on enabling machines to understand and process human language. In text classification, the goal is to categorize text into specific categories, which could be used for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or spam detection. NLP also includes language translation, helping systems automatically translate text from one language to another. Speech recognition converts spoken language into text, and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesizes natural-sounding speech from text input, enabling more interactive and accessible systems.

### Anamoly Detection

Anomaly detection in AI involves identifying patterns that deviate from the expected, often applied to areas like fraud detection, cybersecurity, and health monitoring. This workload relies on identifying outliers in datasets and flagging them for further analysis.

### Predictive Analytics

Predictive Analytics is another important workload that uses historical data to predict future trends. By applying machine learning models, businesses can forecast demand, anticipate equipment failures, and plan more effectively. This workload typically involves time-series forecasting, regression analysis, and pattern recognition.
